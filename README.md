A library for building decentralized applications in Flutter, currently focused on the Tezos platform. Dartez package contains all the function that is required to build tezos application. The package supports both tz1 & tz2 addresses.

## What Is Tezos

Tezos is a decentralized blockchain that governs itself by establishing a true digital commonwealth. It facilitates formal verification, a technique which mathematically proves the correctness of the code governing transactions and boosts the security of the most sensitive or financially weighted smart contracts.
